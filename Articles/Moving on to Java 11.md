# Moving on to Java 11

Now that Java 11 is there, I am upgrading all my personal projects to the new version. There are several reasons to do so:

 - Java 11 is the first LTS version that supports the [Java Module platform system](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/) introduced in Java 9. It does not only help in developing modular software components, but it is also required if we want to create standalone applications using the [jlink](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/jlink.html) tool. If you are interested in how to create standalone Java applications that don't require prior installation of Java, check out my [FxBrowser](https://github.com/xzel23/fxbrowser) example project on Github.
 - Some interesting new [features](https://dzone.com/articles/90-new-features-and-apis-in-jdk-11) were introduced since the last LTS version (Java 8).
- I will leave my current job next summer, so it's good to stay up to date with Java.

I hope I will find the time to post some updates on the process in the coming weeks.
