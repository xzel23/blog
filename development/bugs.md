# Bugs

These are some bugs of interest to me for one reason or the other.

## JDK

 - [JDK-8199014 : WebView: Links to anchors do not work when using loadContent()](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8199014) - mine
 
## Apache POI

## [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

### [JavaFX-Gradle-Plugin](https://github.com/FibreFoX/javafx-gradle-plugin)

 - [Java 10+ support](https://github.com/FibreFoX/javafx-gradle-plugin/issues/103)

## [FontAwesomeFX](http://www.jensd.de/wordpress/?tag=fontawesomefx)
 - [CSSParser unavailable in Java 9](https://bitbucket.org/Jerady/fontawesomefx/issues/48/cssparser-unavailable-in-java-9)

## [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io)

I don't know what's the matter with Jitpack. It's a great site, but there seems to be nearly no progress on issues. Preparing to move on to bintray because of this.

 - [Java 9 support](https://github.com/jitpack/jitpack.io/issues/1592)
 - [JavaFX is not supported Java 9 builds](https://github.com/jitpack/jitpack.io/issues/2310) - mine
