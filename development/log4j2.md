# Log4j2

[Log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) is a logging frameword developped by the Apache Software Foundation. I have switched to using log4j&nbsp;2 instead of [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) in my projects. SLF4J is a great tool too, but some features (state of Java 9 modularization support, Android, ...) tipped the scale.

Some useful links:
- test logging patterns with the [Log4j pattern tester](http://log4jtester.com)
